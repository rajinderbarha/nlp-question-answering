export const largeText = `The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and the fifth largest moon in the Solar System. It is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet. The Moon is a planetary-mass object that formed a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term.

Each month has on average one full moon (which occurs when the entire face of the Moon is illuminated by the Sun). This figure is not the same as the time it takes the Moon to orbit Earth, which is about 27.3 days. This discrepancy is due to the fact that Earth is moving around the Sun at the same time the Moon orbits Earth.

The Moon's gravitational influence is the main driver of Earth's tides and very slowly lengthens Earth's day. The Moon's current orbital distance is about thirty times the diameter of Earth, causing it to appear almost the same size as the Sun in the sky, allowing the Moon to cover the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipses.

The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.5 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The prevailing hypothesis is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.

The Moon has a solid, rocky surface with many impact craters and basaltic plains. It lacks a significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. The surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's, so astronauts can leap much higher on the Moon than they can on Earth.

Humans first landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969, during NASA's Apollo 11 mission. Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first and second humans, respectively, to walk on the lunar surface, while Michael Collins orbited above. The Apollo missions brought back a wealth of scientific data and samples that have greatly enhanced our understanding of the Moon.

The Moon continues to be an object of interest for scientific study and exploration. Future missions aim to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon and use it as a stepping stone for deeper space exploration, including missions to Mars.

Lunar phases are the result of the Moon's orbit around Earth and the relative positions of the Moon, Earth, and Sun. The cycle from one new moon to the next is known as a lunation and lasts about 29.5 days. The phases include new moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, waning gibbous, last quarter, and waning crescent.

The Moon has played an important role in mythology, calendars, and art throughout human history. It has been a symbol of time, fertility, and harvest. Many cultures have myths and legends about the Moon's creation, its phases, and its influence on human life.

In modern times, the Moon is a focal point for scientific research. Its surface is covered with regolith, a layer of loose, fragmented material, and scientists study this material to learn about the Moon's history and the solar system. Robotic missions have mapped the Moon's surface in great detail, providing data for future manned missions.

The Moon's far side, often referred to as the "dark side," was first seen by humans when the Soviet Luna 3 spacecraft sent back images in 1959. This side of the Moon is rugged and heavily cratered, with few large, flat maria like those on the near side. Studying the far side of the Moon can provide insights into the Moon's formation and evolution.

As technology advances, our ability to explore and understand the Moon increases. International collaborations and private companies are working together to return humans to the Moon and develop new technologies for lunar exploration. These efforts will pave the way for future exploration of Mars and beyond.

The Moon remains a constant companion to Earth, influencing tides, stabilizing our planet's axial tilt, and inspiring humanity's quest to explore the cosmos. Its mysteries continue to intrigue scientists and explorers, driving forward our knowledge and capabilities in space exploration.

Space exploration has been a significant aspect of scientific advancement. The Moon landing in 1969 marked a pivotal moment in history. Before Apollo 11, several missions such as Mercury and Gemini prepared NASA for this monumental achievement. The technology developed for these missions paved the way for advancements in many fields including materials science, computer technology, and telecommunications.

The surface of the Moon has been studied extensively through both manned and unmanned missions. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, launched in 2009, has been mapping the Moon's surface with high-resolution imagery. This data helps scientists select landing sites for future missions and understand the geological history of the Moon.

The Moon's regolith, or surface material, is composed of fine dust and rocky debris. This layer varies in thickness across the lunar surface and holds clues about the Moon's history and the impacts it has endured. Scientists study regolith samples brought back by the Apollo missions to learn about the composition of the Moon and its geological processes.

Lunar eclipses occur when the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, casting a shadow on the Moon. There are three types of lunar eclipses: total, partial, and penumbral. Total lunar eclipses are often called "blood moons" because the Moon takes on a reddish hue during the eclipse. This happens because the Earth's atmosphere scatters the sunlight, allowing only the red wavelengths to pass through and illuminate the Moon.

In addition to its scientific significance, the Moon has a profound cultural impact. It has been the subject of folklore, poetry, and art for millennia. Ancient civilizations used lunar calendars to track time and agricultural cycles. The Moon's phases were integral to the development of early calendars and timekeeping systems.

Future lunar missions aim to explore the Moon's south pole, where permanently shadowed craters may contain water ice. This resource could be crucial for sustaining human life and supporting long-term exploration. The Artemis program, led by NASA, plans to return humans to the Moon by 2024 and establish a sustainable presence by the end of the decade. This program will involve international partners and commercial entities, highlighting the collaborative nature of modern space exploration.

The concept of lunar bases has been a topic of interest for decades. Establishing a permanent human presence on the Moon would serve as a testing ground for technologies needed for Mars exploration. It would also provide valuable insights into living and working in space for extended periods. Challenges such as radiation protection, habitat construction, and life support systems need to be addressed to make lunar bases a reality.

The Moon's influence extends beyond tides; it plays a role in stabilizing Earth's axial tilt, which affects the planet's climate and seasons. Without the Moon, Earth's tilt could vary significantly, leading to extreme climate changes. The Moon's gravitational pull also contributes to Earth's rotational slowing, lengthening our days over millions of years.

Astronomy has benefited greatly from lunar observations. The Moon's lack of atmosphere makes it an ideal location for telescopes and other observational instruments. Lunar observatories could provide clearer views of the universe compared to Earth-based telescopes, which are affected by atmospheric distortion.

The exploration of the Moon has inspired generations of scientists, engineers, and dreamers. It represents humanity's spirit of discovery and our desire to push the boundaries of what is possible. As we continue to explore the Moon and beyond, we build on the legacy of those who first dared to dream of space travel.

The history of lunar exploration is marked by both triumphs and challenges. Early missions like the Soviet Luna program and the American Ranger and Surveyor programs provided critical data that informed the Apollo missions. Each success and failure brought us closer to understanding our celestial neighbor.

As we look to the future, the Moon will play a crucial role in our journey to Mars and beyond. Technologies developed for lunar exploration will be adapted for deeper space missions. The lessons learned from living and working on the Moon will prepare us for the challenges of long-duration spaceflight and the establishment of extraterrestrial colonies.

In conclusion, the Moon is more than just a celestial body orbiting Earth. It is a source of scientific knowledge, a cultural icon, and a stepping stone to the stars. Our exploration of the Moon has only just begun, and the possibilities for discovery are limitless. With each mission, we unlock new secrets and pave the way for the next generation of explorers.
